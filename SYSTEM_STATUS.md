## 🔄 Current Workflow

### **Automated Daily Process (Runs Every Morning)**

**7:00 AM Cayman Time - Automatic Check**

The system automatically:
1. Triggers the `scrape-registry` edge function
2. Checks for new petition entries on judicial.ky (if Firecrawl enabled)
3. Compares against existing database entries
4. Identifies new cases by fingerprinting
5. Creates database notifications for new findings
6. Displays alerts on your Dashboard

**You'll see:** Real-time notification banners on the Dashboard showing new case counts and cause numbers.

**Manual Option:** You can also click "Check for New Cases" button anytime for an immediate check.

### **Step 2: Monitor judicial.ky Manually**
**Visit:** https://judicial.ky/public-registers/

1. Filter by "Financial Services"
2. Look for "Petition" or "Winding Up-Petition" entries
3. Note new cause numbers not in your system
4. Download PDFs for those cases

### **Step 3: Add New Cases to Database**
You can add new registry entries via SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO registry_rows (
  cause_number,
  filing_date,
  title,
  subject,
  register_bucket,
  source_html,
  row_fingerprint,
  status
)
VALUES (
  'FSD-XXX/2024',
  '2024-01-20',
  'Company Name - Subject',
  'Winding Up-Petition',
  'Financial Services',
  '<tr><td>FSD-XXX/2024</td></tr>',
  'unique_fingerprint_xxx',
  'awaiting_pdf'
);
```

### **Step 4: Upload PDFs**
**Registry Page → Upload PDF button**

1. Navigate to the Registry page
2. Use the "Awaiting PDF" filter to see cases needing uploads
3. Click "Upload PDF" for each case
4. Select the downloaded PDF file
5. System automatically processes the PDF

### **Step 5: Automatic Processing**
Once uploaded, the system:

1. ✅ Stores PDF bytes in the database
2. ✅ Extracts text using `extract-pdf-text` function
3. ✅ Falls back to OCR if text is minimal (< 50 words)
4. ✅ Parses extracted text with `analyze-case` function
5. ✅ Generates structured JSON data
6. ✅ Creates markdown analysis report
7. ✅ Updates status to "analyzed"

### **Step 6: View Results**
**Registry Page → "View Analysis" button**

- View parsed case information
- See parties, liquidators, timeline
- Review financial amounts
- Read complete analysis report

## 📊 Test Data Available

The system currently has **3 test cases** in the database:

| Cause Number | Status | Subject | Filing Date |
|--------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| FSD-001/2024 | awaiting_pdf | Winding Up-Petition | 2024-01-15 |
| FSD-002/2024 | awaiting_pdf | Petition | 2024-01-16 |
| FSD-003/2024 | awaiting_pdf | Winding Up-Petition | 2024-01-14 |

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### **1. Browser Automation Not Available**
**Issue:** Puppeteer cannot run in Supabase Edge Functions
**Impact:** Cannot automatically scrape judicial.ky website
**Workaround:** Manual monitoring workflow implemented

**Why this happened:**
- Supabase Edge Functions run on Deno runtime
- They don't support headless browsers like Puppeteer
- This is a platform limitation, not a code issue

**Solution implemented:**
- Registry monitoring function now reports on database state
- Users manually monitor judicial.ky and add new cases
- PDF upload and processing remain fully automated

### **2. OCR Requires API Key**
**Issue:** Image-based PDFs need OCR for text extraction
**Impact:** Cases with scanned PDFs may have low extraction confidence
**Workaround:** Configure OCR API key in Settings page

**Supported OCR providers:**
- PDFRest
- ConvertAPI

### **3. Test Data Only**
**Issue:** Database has sample test data only
**Impact:** No real case data yet
**Solution:** Add real cases manually or via SQL

## 📝 Next Actions Needed

### **High Priority:**
1. **Test PDF Upload Flow**
   - Download a sample PDF from judicial.ky
   - Upload it for one of the test cases
   - Verify complete processing pipeline

2. **Add Real Cases**
   - Monitor judicial.ky for actual petition entries
   - Add them to the database
   - Download and upload their PDFs

3. **Configure OCR (Optional)**
   - Get API key from PDFRest or ConvertAPI
   - Add to Settings page
   - Test with image-based PDF

### **Medium Priority:**
4. **Review Analysis Quality**
   - Check if parsing extracts correct information
   - Review parties, liquidators, amounts
   - Adjust parsing patterns if needed

5. **Set Up Notifications**
   - Configure alert email in Settings
   - Or set up Slack webhook
   - Test notification delivery

### **Low Priority:**
6. **Custom Automation**
   - Consider external script to scrape judicial.ky
   - Could run on your local machine or server
   - Post results to Supabase via API

## 📊 Database Statistics

```sql
-- Current state
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM registry_rows) as total_registry_rows,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM registry_rows WHERE status = 'awaiting_pdf') as awaiting_pdf,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cases) as total_cases,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM scrape_jobs) as total_jobs;
```

**Current Results:**
- Total registry rows: 3
- Awaiting PDF: 3
- Total cases: 0
- Total jobs: 1+

## 🛠️ Support & Troubleshooting

### **If Dashboard doesn't load:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection in .env
3. Check network tab for failed requests

### **If PDF upload fails:**
1. Verify file is actually a PDF
2. Check file size (< 10MB recommended)
3. Review browser console for errors
4. Check edge function logs in Supabase dashboard

### **If text extraction fails:**
1. Check if PDF is image-based
2. Configure OCR in Settings
3. Review extraction confidence level
4. Check review queue for flagged items

### **If analysis is incomplete:**
1. Review extracted text quality
2. Check parsed_json field in database
3. Adjust parsing patterns in analyze-case function
4. Add case to review queue for manual verification
